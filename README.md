# Experimenting with a 3D virtual assistant (VERY OLD PROJECT - NO LONGER MAINTAINED)

Animated 3D model responds to user interaction and sends user queries to backend for processing. Has some features that later became the core of Kirino. It works, but many of the processing features integrating 3rd-party services are extremely janky.

I still want to make my own virtual assistant that's embedded on all sorts of devices. I will return to this idea once I've got more experience with natural language processing and don't have to rely on 3rd part services
